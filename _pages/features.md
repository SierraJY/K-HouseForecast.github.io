    * Confirm the installation of Python and required libraries.
    * Open Jupyter Notebook and run the Real_Estate_Prediction.ipynb file.

2. Data Loading

    * Load the data from the 'dataset.csv' file within the code to inspect and preprocess the data.

3. Model Training

    * Train the model using LightGBM.
    * Adjust model hyperparameters in the code if desired.

4. Model Prediction

    * Apply the model to test data or new data for predictions.

5. Results Inspection

    * Visualize and analyze the performance and prediction results of the model.

6. Conclusion

    * Once the tasks are completed, run all cells and save the results.
